		duplicating stacks when splitting IPs..

		added FILE fingerprint, converted NULL fingerprint to short
		.c file...

		Fixed a large number of bugs reguarding threads...

		Made the iterate command (k) work as the specs say it should;
		this differs from both RC/Funge and FBBI.. oh well..

		Really made string mode work like funge specs (I think)...

		 I made it because hey, all that out there IS space.. )
