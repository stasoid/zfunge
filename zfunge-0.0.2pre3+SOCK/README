	zfunge is a funge98 interpreter (une/be/tre) that attempts to
	be as compliant with the 'standard' as possible...

	Currently zfunge implements all funge98 commands, and has a
	befunged93 compatibility mode, also in progress is ANSI tracing
	of the program (It'll be changed to termcap or ncurses eventually).
